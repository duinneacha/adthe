abstract = {Figures and charts are the most influential vehicles for distributing scientific information, for affecting decisions as to the acceptance or rejection of a manuscript, and for attracting the attention of the scientific community to study results. Graphical excellence is mainly defined, first, by the highest possible data density (that is, the amount of information provided per graph area); second, by a low ink-to-data ratio (the avoidance of unnecessary shading, three-dimensionality, gridlines and what is often called 'chartjunk'); and third, by clear and unequivocal labelling of axes. The researcher's essential graphical toolbox should contain histograms, bar charts (always with measures of error), box-and-whiskers plots, scatter plots and forest plots. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Despite the growing recognition of the critical role of post-sale service on the salesperson-customer relationship, few studies have explored how salesperson service behaviors (SSB) are enhanced through tools such as sales-based customer relationship management (CRM) technology and social media. Using dyadic salesperson-customer data within a business-to-business context, this study analyzes the direct effects of sales-based CRM technology on the behaviors of diligence, information communication, inducements, empathy and sportsmanship. Additionally, the study examines the interactive effects of sales-based CRM technology and social media on these behaviors. The results indicate that sales-based CRM technology has a positive influence on SSBs and that salespeople using CRM technology in conjunction with social media are more likely to exhibit higher levels of SSBs than their counterparts with low social media technology use.},

There exist some structured approaches, but still these are not complete and do not have open formats that describe requirements of a system/project with its artefacts. This paper introduces RDS (Requirement Description Schema), an XML-based versatile specification approach for the structural representation of functional and non-functional requirements (NFR). The approach is an efficient way of managing requirement metadata and comprehensive artefacts of requirements like status, priority, version, stability, elicitation source etc. The paper comprises a case study of online examination system for validating the instances with RDS.},

abstract = {The present study sought to examine the underpinnings of impaired strategic decision-making under stress. In contrast to previous laboratory-based research, we conducted a quasi-experiment in a real life stress situation. Specifically, we used the beauty contest game and compared the performance of a group of participants who were exposed to a real-life stressor (waiting to attend an exam at a university class) with a control group of participants who were not exposed to stress (waiting to attend a regular lecture at a university class). Furthermore, about half of the participants were instructed to write down what they believed another participant had assumed the average number in the beauty contest game to be and which target number she (or he) had chosen accordingly. The results showed that stress impaired strategic reasoning in the beauty contest game. Importantly, even when only including participants who understood the rules of the game in the analyses, stress still increased the numbers chosen in the beauty contest. Furthermore, we found that participants in the stress condition were significantly less likely to base their chosen number on their belief about other players' choices. Hence, stress not only impairs understanding of the math behind the beauty contest game but also the degree of strategizing per se.},

Digital business ecosystem (DBE) is centralized collaboration environment of the species as stakeholder communities within the business ecosystem. This paper describes to model the responsive supply chain through the analysis and design to answer the stakeholder's needs of information and decisions, and involve in managing product and perishable material as well. Therefore, the objectives of this research are to identify the component and process in systems analysis, to develop the design responsive supply chain system of pineapple multi product for SME. The benefits that can be obtained by digitalized information are cost efficiency and effectiveness of service time for SMEs, employees and consumers when it responds quickly to changes the information system, supply of raw materials, production facilities and inventory system. The research approach includes decomposition of process analysis by business process model notation (BPMN). Then quantitative modeling design deployed decision tree classifier method. The model consisted of structures, information system, mode transportation, raw material and finish good inventory. The last step is optimization of responsive model by cross platform drivers function. Computational results and managerial insights are provided. To show that substantial reduction in response time can achieved with minimal increase in total cost in the design of responsive supply chain.},

@inproceedings{Dombrowski2014,
abstract = {Lean leadership could be the missing link between toolbox lean and a sustainable continuously improving organization. More and more enterprises realize that they have so far basically focused on the visible parts of lean production systems. Although process optimization with the various methods like kanban, 5S, SMED, FIFO and many more is very effective to achieve short term improvements, after a few years, the lean programs of many enterprises do not meet the expectations anymore. The common approach can be explained by using the 4P Model. It consists of 4 levels that are all necessary for a sustainable lean implementation. The levels are: philosophy (long-Term thinking), process (eliminate waste), people and partner (respect, challenge and grow them) and problem solving (CIP and learning). All these terms are wellknown. However, most enterprises merely focus on process. Eliminating waste in all processes has been preponderantly adopted, whereas the other 3Ps, the "invisible" parts of lean, are less easy to adopt but equally important for the sustainable implementation. Lean leadership addresses all 4Ps and provides a methodical system for the sustainable implementation and continuous improvement of lean production systems. It describes the cooperation of employees and leaders in their mutual striving for perfection. By now, many authors have identified the need for a lean leadership but only few holistic concepts exist. Especially lower and middle management lacks some clear advices and rules for lean leadership implementation. Therefore, some indicators for successful lean leadership were deduced from literature, study results, and practical experiences of lean implementation. The indicators were found in advices given on successful lean implementations, but particularly in mistakes and shortcomings. After reformulating the indicators into requirements for leaders, they were assigned to the five principles improvement culture, self-development, qualification, gemba, and hoshin kanri. These requirements shall help executives in realizing lean leadership. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Naldi2016,
abstract = {Companies typically select those projects that maximize their profit as the primary criterion, within the limited budget at their disposal. This criterion may lead to some company departments getting an exceedingly large share of the overall budget and induce a negative perception of unfairness among the less favourite ones. We investigate how profit optimization can be sought after while achieving the desired level of fairness at the same time. Adopting a maximin approach to fairness and using an Integer Linear Programming solver, we show that a linear trade-off is possible, since fairness and profit exhibit a nearly perfect linear anticorrelation. Fairness can be improved by even a relatively small reduction of profit, especially in large companies (i.e., managing a large number of projects).},
